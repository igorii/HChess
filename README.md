Console chess game written in Haskell using FEN notation

This is my first attempt at a useful Haskell program. For now, it is able to play a game of chess on the Honor System. I'll be coming back to this project when I've learned enough Haskell to effectively write an AI and a move validator.

There is likely a lot of silly code here. If you find something outrageous, or something just irks you, I encourage you to drop a tip at timthornton.net/blog, where the literate code will be used as a post.
